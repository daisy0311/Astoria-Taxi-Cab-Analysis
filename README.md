# Astoria-Taxi-Cab-Analysis

In this project, Iâ€™m going to use the NYC taxi/cab data in 2013 from 
1. BiqQuery https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/imjasonh-storage:nyctaxi.trip_data. 
2. Taxi zones reference: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml (Also attached as an html file in google maps.) 
to analyze the taxi/cab usage in Astoria district.
